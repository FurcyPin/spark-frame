## What is it ?

Spark-frame is a library that brings several utility methods and transformation functions for PySpark DataFrames.
These methods were initially part of the [karadoc](https://github.com/FurcyPin/karadoc) project 
used at [Younited](https://medium.com/younited-tech-blog), but they don't rely on karadoc, so it makes more sense 
to keep them as standalone library.

Several of these methods were my initial inspiration to make the cousin project 
[bigquery-frame](https://github.com/FurcyPin/bigquery-frame), which is why you will find similar 
methods in `transformations` and `data_diff` for both `spark_frame` and `bigquery_frame`, except
the former runs on PySpark while the latter runs on BigQuery (obviously).

## Installation

[spark-frame is available on PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/spark-frame/).

```bash
pip install spark-frame
```
